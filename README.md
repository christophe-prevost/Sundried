[Sundried][homepage] is a colour scheme for [Sublime Text 2][st2].  I created
it because I found most dark schemes out there (including Sublime's default) to
look too "glowing neon".

It has a simple definition that colours the following generic scopes:

* keyword   (green)
* storage   (orange)
* support   (gold)
* string    (blue)
* comment   (grey)
* constant  (red)
* entity    (orange)
* invalid   (framed in red)

There are currently no language-specific specialisations. If you would like to
propose some, you are welcome to send a GitHub pull request.
