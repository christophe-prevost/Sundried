[Sundried][homepage] is a colour scheme for [Sublime Text 2][st2]. I created it
because I found most dark schemes out there (including Sublime's default) to
look too "glowing neon".

It has a simple definition that styles:

* The language-independent [root groups][tmlang] for text and source code.
* Sublime's various visual cues in the text area, including matched brackets
and line / selection / find highlights.
